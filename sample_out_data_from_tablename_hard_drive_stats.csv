Attribute name,Ideal,!,Description
Reallocated Sectors Count,Low,Critical,"Count of reallocated sectors. The raw value represents a count of the bad sectors that have been found and remapped.[25] Thus, the higher the attribute value, the more sectors the drive has had to reallocate. This value is primarily used as a metric of the life expectancy of the drive; a drive which has had any reallocations at all is significantly more likely to fail in the immediate months.[22][26]"
,Lower,[22][23][24],
Spin Retry Count,Low,Critical,Count of retry of spin start attempts. This attribute stores a total count of the spin start attempts to reach the fully operational speed (under the condition that the first attempt was unsuccessful). An increase of this attribute value is a sign of problems in the hard disk mechanical subsystem.
,Lower,,
End-to-End error / IOEDC ,Low,Critical,"This attribute is a part of Hewlett-Packard's SMART IV technology, as well as part of other vendors' IO Error Detection and Correction schemas, and it contains a count of parity errors which occur in the data path to the media via the drive's cache RAM.[41]"
,Lower,,
Reported Uncorrectable Errors,Low,Critical,The count of errors that could not be recovered using hardware ECC (see attribute 195).[42]
,Lower,,
Reallocation Event Count[45],Low,Critical,Count of remap operations. The raw value of this attribute shows the total count of attempts to transfer data from reallocated sectors to a spare area. Both successful and unsuccessful attempts are counted.[57]
,Lower,,
Current Pending Sector Count[45],Low,Critical,"Count of ""unstable"" sectors (waiting to be remapped, because of unrecoverable read errors). If an unstable sector is subsequently read successfully, the sector is remapped and this value is decreased. Read errors on a sector will not remap the sector immediately (since the correct value cannot be read and so the value to remap is not known, and also it might become readable later); instead, the drive firmware remembers that the sector needs to be remapped, and will remap it the next time it's written.[58]"
,Lower,[4][40][43],"However, some drives will not immediately remap such sectors when written; instead the drive will first attempt to write to the problem sector and if the write operation is successful then the sector will be marked good (in this case, the ""Reallocation Event Count"" (0xC4) will not be increased). This is a serious shortcoming, for if such a drive contains marginal sectors that consistently fail only after some time has passed following a successful write operation, then the drive will never remap these problem sectors."
(Offline) Uncorrectable Sector Count[45],Low,Critical,The total count of uncorrectable errors when reading/writing a sector. A rise in the value of this attribute indicates defects of the disk surface and/or problems in the mechanical subsystem.[4][43][40]

SATA Downshift Error Count or Runtime Bad Block,Low,,"Western Digital, Samsung or Seagate attribute: Either the number of downshifts of link speed (e.g. from 6Gbps to 3Gbps) or the total number of data blocks with detected, uncorrectable errors encountered during normal operation.[38] Although degradation of this parameter can be an indicator of drive aging and/or potential electromechanical problems, it does not directly indicate imminent drive failure.[39]"
,Lower,,
High Fly Writes,Low,,"HDD manufacturers implement a flying height sensor that attempts to provide additional protections for write operations by detecting when a recording head is flying outside its normal operating range. If an unsafe fly height condition is encountered, the write process is stopped, and the information is rewritten or reallocated to a safe region of the hard drive. This attribute indicates the count of these errors detected over the lifetime of the drive."
,Lower,,"This feature is implemented in most modern Seagate drives[2] and some of Western Digital's drives, beginning with the WD Enterprise WDE18300 and WDE9180 Ultra2 SCSI hard drives, and will be included on all future WD Enterprise products.[44]"

On the other hand, the WD3000GLFS (a desktop drive) is specified for only 50,000 load/unload cycles.[49]"
,,,"Some laptop drives and ""green power"" desktop drives are programmed to unload the heads whenever there has not been any activity for a short period, to save power.[50][51] Operating systems often access the file system a few times a minute in the background,[52] causing 100 or more load cycles per hour if the heads unload: the load cycle rating may be exceeded in less than a year.[53] There are programs for most operating systems that disable the Advanced Power Management (APM) and Automatic acoustic management (AAM) features causing frequent load cycles.[54][55]"

,,,
Seek Error Rate,Varies,,"(Vendor specific raw value.) Rate of seek errors of the magnetic heads. If there is a partial failure in the mechanical positioning system, then seek errors will arise.
